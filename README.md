1. Project Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation of a basic heater control system, developed as part of the upliance.ai Embedded Systems Intern Assignment. The system aims to simulate a temperature-based control mechanism that turns a "heater" on or off based on predefined temperature thresholds, ensuring a target temperature is maintained while also incorporating overheating protection.

2. Part 1: System Design
2.1. Minimum Sensors Required
The primary and minimum sensor required for this heater control system is a temperature sensor.

An LM35 Temperature Sensor is chosen for its linear output (10mV per degree Celsius), ease of use, and direct analog output, which simplifies interfacing with the microcontroller's Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

2.2. Communication Protocol Recommendation and Justification
For communication between the temperature sensor and the microcontroller, the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol is recommended.

Justification:

Simplicity: I2C requires only two wires for data transfer (SDA - Serial Data Line and SCL - Serial Clock Line), reducing wiring complexity compared to parallel interfaces.

Multi-device Support: It supports multiple slave devices on the same bus, which is beneficial for future expansion (e.g., adding more sensors) without requiring additional microcontroller pins.

Sufficiency for Application: For temperature sensing, the data rate offered by I2C is more than adequate, as temperature readings do not require high-speed, real-time data streaming.

Standardization: I2C is a widely adopted standard, meaning many sensors and peripherals are available with I2C interfaces, simplifying component selection.

Module Descriptions:

Temperature Sensor (LM35): Measures the current temperature.

Microcontroller (ESP32 Dev Module): The central processing unit. It reads temperature data, executes the control logic, and manages the output to the heater and indicators. ESP32 is chosen for its robust capabilities and built-in Wi-Fi/BLE for potential future enhancements.

Actuating Circuit (Simulated Heater - Red LED): Represents the heating element. A Red LED is used in the simulation to visually indicate when the heater is "ON." In a real system, this would typically involve a relay controlling a heating element.

Power Supply: Provides the necessary electrical power to all components.

Serial Monitor: Used for debugging and logging temperature readings and system states in real-time.

Buzzer/LED (Bonus): A buzzer provides an audible alarm for critical events (e.g., overheating), and a Green LED indicates the system's "Idle" or "Target Reached" state.

2.4. Future Roadmap
The system can evolve to support more advanced functionalities:

Overheating Protection Enhancements:

Redundant Sensing: Integrate a second, independent temperature sensor. If readings from both sensors diverge significantly or both exceed a critical threshold, the system can trigger an immediate shutdown and alarm, providing a fail-safe mechanism.

Hardware Cutoff: Implement a hardware-based thermal fuse or bimetallic switch that physically interrupts power to the heating element if a dangerous temperature is reached, acting as a last line of defense independent of software.

Intelligent Shutdown: Introduce a "cool-down" phase after an overheat event, where the system prevents the heater from turning back on until the temperature has dropped to a safe, pre-defined level, and potentially requires a manual reset.

Multiple Heating Profiles:

User Interface (UI): Develop a simple UI using an LCD display and push buttons, or a mobile application (via Wi-Fi/BLE), allowing users to select different pre-defined heating profiles (e.g., "Boil," "Simmer," "Warm," "Custom").

Profile Storage: Store multiple sets of temperature thresholds (e.g., target, heating, stabilizing ranges) in the microcontroller's non-volatile memory (e.g., EEPROM or Flash) that can be loaded based on the selected profile.

Time-Based Scheduling: Incorporate a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module to enable scheduled heating operations (e.g., "heat to 50Â°C at 7 AM").

PID Control: Transition from simple ON/OFF control to a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm for more precise temperature regulation, minimizing overshoot and maintaining temperature within a tighter range. This would involve continuous adjustment of heater power rather than just on/off.

Adaptive Learning: Implement basic machine learning techniques to analyze usage patterns and environmental factors, allowing the system to adapt and optimize heating cycles for better efficiency and user experience.

3. Part 2: Embedded Implementation
3.1. Platform and Language
Platform: Wokwi (Online ESP32/Arduino Simulator)

Language: C/C++ (Arduino Framework for ESP32)

3.2. Requirements Implemented
The provided sketch.ino implements the following core requirements:

Temperature-Based State Tracker: A finite state machine is implemented with the following states:

IDLE: Heater is off, temperature is below the HEATING_THRESHOLD.

HEATING: Temperature is below TARGET_TEMPERATURE, heater is active.

STABILIZING: Temperature has reached or slightly exceeded TARGET_TEMPERATURE, heater is off, allowing for thermal inertia.

TARGET_REACHED: Temperature is within the desired STABILIZE_LOWER and STABILIZE_UPPER range, heater is off.

OVERHEAT: Temperature has exceeded OVERHEAT_THRESHOLD, heater is forced off, and an alarm is triggered.

Continuous Temperature Reading: The LM35 sensor is read periodically (every 2 seconds) using a non-blocking millis() based approach.

Heater Control: A Red LED (simulating the heater) is turned ON or OFF based on the current state and temperature thresholds.

Serial Logging: Temperature readings, current system state, and heater status are continuously logged to the Serial Monitor for real-time monitoring and debugging.

3.3. Bonus Features Implemented
Buzzer/LED Indicator for Visual/Audio Feedback:

A Green LED (STATUS_LED_PIN) illuminates when the system is in IDLE or TARGET_REACHED states, indicating a safe and stable condition.

A buzzer (BUZZER_PIN) emits an alarm sound for 1 second when the system enters the OVERHEAT state.
